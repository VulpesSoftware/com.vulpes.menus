# Menu Widgets

**Menu Widgets** are custom UI elements built from one or more base UI interactables (for example a **Slider** that can also be adjusted using **Buttons** and an **Input Field**).


## Hints
* There is a generic example Menu Widget for each available type included as part of the Menu Samples, you can use these as templates for building your own widgets.
