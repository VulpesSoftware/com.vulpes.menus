# About Vulpes Menus

The Vulpes Menu Framework is a Promise driven menu system that serves as a companion to Unity’s built-in UI system.

## Understanding Promises

This Framework relies heavily on [Vulpes Promises](https://github.com/VulpesSoftware/com.vulpes.promises) which is a package that was derived from RSG’s [C# Promises](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/C-Sharp-Promise) library.

In order to use this library effectively you should first learn about Promises:
- [Promises on Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises)
- [Good overview](https://www.promisejs.org/)
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
