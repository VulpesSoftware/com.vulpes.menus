# Vulpes Menu Framework

*This is a preview package and is subject to radical change, please use at your own peril.*

A Promise driven game menu framework for Unity.

*NOTE:* This Package depends on '[com.vulpes.promises](https://github.com/VulpesSoftware/com.vulpes.promises.git#1.0.0)', due to current limitations of the Unity Package Manager you should install that package prior to installing this one to avoid errors.

## Using this library

To use this library efficiently you should first learn about Promises:

- [Promises on Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises)
- [Good overview](https://www.promisejs.org/)
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

## Samples

Samples will be added to this repository soon and will be installable via the Package Manager window in the Unity Editor.
